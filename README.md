# 📊 Student Performance Analysis

This project explores a student performance dataset to uncover insights about factors that may influence students’ academic success.  
The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and contains information on GPA, study time, absences, parental education, extracurricular activities, and more.

## 📁 Project Structure

- **Notebook:** `Student Performance Analysis.ipynb`  
  Contains all the data exploration, visualizations, and results.
- **Data:** `Student_performance_data.csv`  
  (or the Kaggle link if you don’t store raw data in the repo)

## ✅ Key Analytical Questions

1. **How does weekly study time affect GPA?**
   - Analyzed the relationship between `StudyTimeWeekly` and `GPA` using scatter plots with regression lines.

2. **What is the relationship between absences and GPA?**
   - Visualized using scatter plots with regression lines to show how higher absences relate to lower GPAs.

3. **Is participation in extracurricular activities associated with GPA?**
   - Compared GPA distributions for students participating in **sports**, **music**, and **volunteering** using boxplots.

4. **How does GPA compare across different ethnicities?**
   - Used boxplots to explore GPA differences between ethnic groups.

## 📈 Key Findings

- More study time is generally associated with a slightly higher GPA.
- Higher absences show a clear negative impact on GPA.
- Participation in sports, music, and volunteering shows small positive trends in GPA.
- GPA distribution appears relatively similar across ethnicities in this dataset.

## ⚙️ Tools Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Seaborn**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
